<h1>ðŸ§  Backend Logic</h1>
The backend uses a keyword-based emotion detection system. Hereâ€™s how it works:

When a POST request is made to /analyze with a reflection text like:
"I feel nervous about my first job interview"

The backend:
Converts text to lowercase and splits it into words.
Searches for keywords (e.g., "nervous", "happy", "mad") in a predefined dictionary.
Assigns the first matched emotion.
Confidence score is calculated based on how early the word appears in the sentence.
An appropriate emoji is also returned.
